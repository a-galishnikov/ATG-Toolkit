    Reports when type of either dependency or its field cannot be cast to type of the field which is set to <br>
    <i>Report could be false positive if the finals classes of the component or its dependencies weren't detected
        properly considering layers priority</i>
</p>
<p>
    For example such error occurs if component's class has field:
    <code><pre>
        private Repository repository;
        public setRepository(Repository repository) {...}
    </pre>
    </code>

    But totally different component is injected to this field via its .properties file
    <code><pre>
        repository=/atg/commerce/order/OrderTools
    </pre>
    </code>
